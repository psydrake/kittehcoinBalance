# KittehCoin Balance

## About
Simple web / mobile app for checking the balance of your KittehCoin wallet address(es).

## Technical
KittehCoin Balance consists of two parts:
* A pure HTML / CSS / JavaScript front end built with the [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) JavaScript framework.
* A [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) back end, written in [Python](http://www.python.org/), that caches data from the [cryptocoincharts.info](http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/) API.

The front end communicates with the back end via [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) calls. The backend polls cryptocoincharts.info every 10 minutes, and it stores this data in [memcache](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/memcache/) for all subsequent client requests, in order to reduce load on the CryptoCoinCharts server.
